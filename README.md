# CNN Model on MNIST Dataset

1. Objective
The aim of this project is to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The CNN model leverages convolutional layers to extract spatial features from images and achieves higher accuracy compared to traditional models by recognizing patterns like edges and textures.

2. Services the Model Provides
- Digit Classification: The trained CNN model can predict the digit (0-9) from a 28x28 pixel grayscale image with high accuracy.
- Model Evaluation: It provides performance metrics such as accuracy, loss, and confusion matrix to assess the model’s efficiency.
- Image Classification Pipeline: A structured pipeline from data preprocessing, model training, validation, and testing to ensure reliable and scalable digit recognition.


3. Tools Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries and Frameworks:
- TensorFlow / Keras: For building, training, and -  testing the CNN model.
- NumPy: For numerical computations.
- Pandas: For data handling.
- Matplotlib: For visualizing performance metrics such as accuracy and loss curves.
- scikit-learn: For additional tasks like train-test split and evaluation metrics.


4. CNN Model Architecture
- Input Layer: 28x28 grayscale images (1 channel).
- Convolutional Layers: Extract spatial features using 2D convolutions.
- Max-Pooling Layers: Downsample feature maps to reduce dimensionality.
- Fully Connected Layers: Flattened output connected to dense layers for classification.
- Output Layer: Softmax layer for digit classification (0-9).

5. Resources
Dataset: MNIST Dataset – A dataset of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits.
